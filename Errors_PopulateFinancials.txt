    This may happen intermittently and you should catch errors appropriately.
    However:  1) if this recently started happening on every request for a symbol
    that used to work, Yahoo may have changed their API.  2) If this happens on
    every request for a symbol you've never used before, but not for other
    symbols, you've found an edge-case (OR, we may just be protecting you from
    "bad" data sometimes stored for e.g. misspelt symbols on Yahoo's side).
    Please see if anyone has reported this previously:
