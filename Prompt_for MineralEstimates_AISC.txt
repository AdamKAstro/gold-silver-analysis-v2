when I provide you with a company ticker and name (e.g., AAN.V, ATON RESOURCES), follow these steps to update the companies, mineral_estimates, and costs tables with accurate and comprehensive data:
Step 1: Research the Company
Sources: Use reliable sources such as the company's official website, latest annual reports, quarterly reports, investor presentations, SEDAR filings (NI 43-101 technical reports, financial statements, management discussions), and recent news releases.

Objective: Gather all necessary data to update the company details, mineral estimates, and cost metrics, ensuring completeness and accuracy.

Step 2: Update Company Details (companies Table)
TSX Code and Name: Verify the ticker (e.g., AAN.V) and full company name (e.g., ATON RESOURCES). *** these are my master key fields, make sure the sql entries for name and company id are not updated/changed)

Status: Determine if the company is a producer, explorer, or developer based on current activities.

Headquarters: Identify the location of the companyâ€™s headquarters (city and country).

Minerals of Interest: List the primary minerals targeted (e.g., gold, silver), focusing on gold and silver.

Percent Gold and Silver: Calculate the percentage of focus on gold and silver based on production or exploration emphasis (sum to 100% if only precious metals; adjust if non-precious metals are significant).

Description: Write a concise description including key projects and notable details (e.g., locations, stages).

Last Updated: Set to the current date and time in ISO format (e.g., 2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z).

Step 3: Aggregate Mineral Estimates (mineral_estimates Table)
Project Identification: List all company projects across all jurisdictions.

Resource Categories: For each project, collect the latest estimates from technical reports or company disclosures:
Proven and Probable Reserves

Measured and Indicated Resources

Inferred Resources (as resources)

Potential Resources (if speculative estimates are provided)

Mineable Resources (if explicitly stated)

Metal Quantities: Record quantities of gold (oz), silver (oz), and other metals (e.g., tonnes for base metals).

Conversion to AuEq: Convert all metals to gold equivalent ounces (AuEq Moz) using industry-standard conversion factors (e.g., based on current metal prices like $1,900/oz for gold, $22/oz for silver).

Aggregation: Sum AuEq Moz across all projects for each category.

Categorization:
Precious Metals: Gold and silver contributions to AuEq Moz.

Non-Precious Metals: Other metals (e.g., copper, zinc) contributions to AuEq Moz, if applicable.

Total: Sum of precious and non-precious AuEq Moz for each category.

Fields to Populate:
reserves_precious_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_precious_aueq_moz, resources_precious_aueq_moz, potential_precious_aueq_moz, mineable_precious_aueq_moz

reserves_non_precious_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_non_precious_aueq_moz, resources_non_precious_aueq_moz, potential_non_precious_aueq_moz, mineable_non_precious_aueq_moz

reserves_total_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_total_aueq_moz, resources_total_aueq_moz, potential_total_aueq_moz, mineable_total_aueq_moz

Last Updated: Set to the current date and time.

Note: If data is unavailable for a field, set it to NULL.

Step 4: Gather Cost Data (costs Table)
Cost Metrics: Collect the following from financial statements or reports:
AISC (All-In Sustaining Cost): Last quarter (aisc_last_quarter), last year (aisc_last_year), future projections (aisc_future), with currencies (e.g., USD, CAD).

AIC (All-In Cost): Last quarter (aic_last_quarter), last year (aic_last_year), with currencies.

TCO (Total Cash Cost): Current (tco_current), future (tco_future), with currencies.

Availability: If the company is not a producer, these may be NULL (typical for explorers/developers).

Last Updated: Set to the current date and time.

Note: Include all fields, setting unavailable data to NULL.

Step 5: Format and Update the Database
SQL Format: Generate UPDATE statements for each table in the following format, ensuring all fields are explicitly set (even to NULL if no data exists).

Assumption: The company_id is known and pre-populated for all 501 companies.

Example Application: AAN.V, ATON RESOURCES
Assuming the following researched data for demonstration:
Company Details: Explorer, headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, focused solely on gold, with key projects in Egypt (Hamama, Abu Marawat).

Mineral Estimates: Measured & Indicated = 0.5 Moz Au, Inferred = 1.2 Moz Au, Potential = 2.0 Moz Au (all precious, no non-precious metals).

Accuracy: Cross-check data with primary sources (NI 43-101, financials) to ensure reliability.

Completeness: Include all projects and jurisdictions in mineral estimates; do not omit any reported data.

Null Values: Use NULL for missing data rather than guessing or leaving blank.

Currency: Always specify currency for cost fields when available.

Flexibility: Adjust values based on actual research for each company; the example above is illustrative.

This prompt ensures that all fields are addressed, resources are aggregated comprehensively, and the output is formatted correctly as SQL UPDATE statements."
