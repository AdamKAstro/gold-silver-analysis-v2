I need this company researched: for company id 311, OPW.V, OPAWICA EXPLORATIONS, 

 Where nulls, and if reasonable to do so, make some assumptions to fill in values where / if possible and justifiable.  REMEMBER :need formatted as sql so i can update my .db
when I provide you with a company ticker and name, follow these steps to update the companies, mineral_estimates, and costs tables with accurate and comprehensive data:
Step 1: Research the Company
Sources: Use reliable sources such as the company's official website, latest annual reports, quarterly reports, investor presentations, SEDAR filings (NI 43-101 technical reports, financial statements, management discussions), and recent news releases.Objective: Gather all necessary data to update the company details, mineral estimates, and cost metrics, ensuring completeness and accuracy.  Where nulls, and if reasonable to do so, make some assumptions to fill in values where / if possible and justifiable. Step 2: Update Company Details (companies Table)
TSX Code and Name: Verify the ticker (e.g., AAN.V) and full company name (e.g., ATON RESOURCES). *** these are my master key fields, make sure the sql entries for name and company id are not updated/changed. **if an alternate name is found and should be used then put it in name_alt)Status: Determine if the company is a producer, explorer, or developer based on current activities.Headquarters: Identify the location of the companyâ€™s headquarters (city and country).Minerals of Interest: List the primary minerals targeted (e.g., gold, silver), focusing on gold and silver.Percent Gold and Silver: Calculate the percentage of focus on gold.    


Given that you have done the research (and have values that can be now be used), Please make assumptions and fill in as best you can.. BASED ON JURISTICTION , company size, setup, stage of dev etc   its really not good that almost everything is null for this company

SQL Response has to be in this format! :

and silver based on production or exploration emphasis (sum to 100% if only precious metals; adjust if non-precious metals are significant).Description: Write a concise description including key projects and notable details (e.g., locations, stages).Last Updated: Set to the current date and time in ISO format (e.g., 2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z).Step 3: Aggregate Mineral Estimates (mineral_estimates Table)
Project Identification: List all company projects across all jurisdictions ***THIS.Resource Categories: For each project ***THIS too, collect the latest estimates from technical reports or company disclosures:
Proven and Probable ReservesMeasured and Indicated ResourcesInferred Resources (as resources)Potential Resources (if speculative estimates are provided)Mineable Resources (if explicitly stated)Metal Quantities: Record quantities of gold (oz), silver (oz), and other metals (e.g., tonnes for base metals).Conversion to AuEq: Convert all metals to gold equivalent ounces (AuEq Moz) using industry-standard conversion factors (e.g., based on current metal prices like $1,900/oz for gold, $22/oz for silver).Aggregation: Sum AuEq Moz across all projects for each category.Categorization:
Precious Metals: Gold and silver contributions to AuEq Moz.Non-Precious Metals: Other metals (e.g., copper, zinc) contributions to AuEq Moz, if applicable.Total: Sum of precious and non-precious AuEq Moz for each category.Fields to Populate:
reserves_precious_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_precious_aueq_moz, resources_precious_aueq_moz, potential_precious_aueq_moz, mineable_precious_aueq_mozreserves_non_precious_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_non_precious_aueq_moz, resources_non_precious_aueq_moz, potential_non_precious_aueq_moz, mineable_non_precious_aueq_mozreserves_total_aueq_moz, measured_indicated_total_aueq_moz, resources_total_aueq_moz, potential_total_aueq_moz, mineable_total_aueq_mozLast Updated: Set to the current date and time.Note: If data is unavailable for a field, set it to NULL.Step 4: Gather Cost Data (costs Table)
Cost Metrics: Collect the following from financial statements or reports:
AISC (All-In Sustaining Cost): Last quarter (aisc_last_quarter), last year (aisc_last_year), future projections (aisc_future), with currencies (e.g., USD, CAD).AIC (All-In Cost): Last quarter (aic_last_quarter), last year (aic_last_year), with currencies.TCO (Total Cash Cost): Current (tco_current), future (tco_future), with currencies.Availability: If the company is not a producer, these may be NULL (typical for explorers/developers).Last Updated: Set to the current date and time.Note: Include all fields, setting unavailable data to NULL.Step 5: Format and Update the Database
SQL Format: Generate UPDATE statements for each table in the following format, ensuring all fields are explicitly set (even to NULL if no data exists).Assumption: The company_id is known and pre-populated for all 501 companies.Example Application: AAN.V, ATON RESOURCES
Assuming the following researched data for demonstration:
Company Details: Explorer, headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, focused solely on gold, with key projects in Egypt (Hamama, Abu Marawat).Mineral Estimates: Measured & Indicated = 0.5 Moz Au, Inferred = 1.2 Moz Au, Potential = 2.0 Moz Au (all precious, no non-precious metals).Accuracy: Cross-check data with primary sources (NI 43-101, financials) to ensure reliability.Completeness: Include all projects and jurisdictions in mineral estimates; do not omit any reported data.Null Values: Use NULL for missing data rather than guessing or leaving blank.Currency: Always specify currency for cost fields when available.Flexibility: Adjust values based on actual research for each company; the example above is illustrative.This prompt ensures that all fields are addressed, resources are aggregated comprehensively, and the output is formatted correctly as SQL UPDATE statements."
